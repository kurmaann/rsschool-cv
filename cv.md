3-I am from the city of Aktobe , currently living in Almaty, studying at the 3rd year of IITU University, in the specialty of SIS. My goal is to become successful and I am ready to develop. The priority for me will always be family and health in the first place, and after that career and personal growth. My strong point has always been positive, I can find a common language with most people, I'm not afraid of rejection and I'm not shy of the crowd. I strive for heights and new knowledge.
